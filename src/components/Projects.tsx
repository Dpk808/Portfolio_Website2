      description:
        "This project showcases a simple yet effective CI/CD setup using Jenkins, GitHub Webhooks, and ngrok. Jenkins is configured to automatically pull and build code from GitHub whenever changes are pushed, thanks to webhooks exposed via ngrok. This setup demonstrates the fundamentals of Continuous Integration and Deployment, automating the entire code-to-build process for real-world DevOps learning.",

      title: "File Upload Server on Kubernetes",
      description:
        "A Flask-based file upload application deployed on Kubernetes with Persistent Volumes (PV) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVC) for durable file storage. The Docker image is pushed to DockerHub and deployed via YAML manifests defining the Deployment, Service, and PVC. Files remain persistent across pod restarts, ensuring reliability and demonstrating cloud-native storage management on Kubernetes.",

      title: "Logs and Metrics Visualization for Upload Server",
      description:
        "Integrated Loki, Prometheus, and Grafana to monitor and visualize logs and metrics of the Flask upload server on Kubernetes. Loki handled log aggregation, Prometheus scraped performance metrics, and Grafana unified both for observability dashboards. This provided real-time insights into application performance, uptime, and errors — achieving end-to-end monitoring and troubleshooting visibility.",
